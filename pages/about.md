This website is created with the vision of sharing knowledge in the field of
Fashion. Our team helps students to learn and prepare for various entrance exams of
institutes such as NIFT, NID etc. 


We publish our tutorials, opinions, and
articles on trending topics in fashion and technology. We also have a free
daily newsletter for our readers and we are planning to bring a paid Fashion
weekly too.

On this website, readers can find questions banks, topics for group discussions
and about latest trends in Fashion Industry. Students can connect with each
other to learn and make study groups to crack the entrance examinations of
institutes for Fashion studies. 

Currently we allow discussions only through
disqus. In future, we plan to create more engaging community as we believe that
all can learn faster when we copy and learn from each other.
