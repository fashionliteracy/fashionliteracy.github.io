### What is the meaning of A/An and The

In English, _a_, _an_, and _the_ are called articles. These are also called
_determiners_. 

These articles are also sometimes classified as adjectives
because they tell something about a _noun_ and are always used before a _noun_.


### How To Use _A/An_?

If the speaker **does NOT know** about the noun that is being referred in a _sentence_
then she/he uses **_a_** or **_an_**. 

Therefore, **_a_** or **_an_** is also called an indefinite article.

Let us look at some examples:

- _Do you have **a** pen?_


_**Person 1**: Are you eating **a** cherry?_

_**Person 2**: No, I am eating **an** apple._


**Notes**: 

- Use _a_ before a _noun_ that starts with a _consonant_.
- Use _an_ before a _noun_ that starts with a _vowel_.


### How To Use _The_?

If the speaker **knows** about the noun that is being referred to in a _sentence_
then she/he uses **_the_**.


Therefore, **_The_**  is also called a definite article.

Let us look at some examples:

- _Where did you keep **the** pen?_

_**Person 1**: Have you finished eating **the** apple?_

_**Person 2**: Yes, I have._


In other words, when a speaker says about a non-specific _noun_ then she makes
use of an article _a_ or _an_. 

When a speaker says about a specific _noun_ then she makes use of article
_the_.


### Comparison of _A/An_ and _The_



| Non-Specific | Specific |
---------|-----------
| Have you been to _**a**_ museum? | Did you go to _**the**_ museum in our town? |

In the above-given comparison, when the speaker is asking about any museum,
which is not known to the speaker, she makes use of the article _a_. 

When she wants to know about the visit to a specific museum, then she uses the
article _the_.

small quiz. All the best!
