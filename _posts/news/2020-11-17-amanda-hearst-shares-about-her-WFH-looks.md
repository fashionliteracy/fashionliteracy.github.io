Outside of her role as curator, Hearst has her hands deep in the nonprofit world. She runs well beings with co-founder Breanna Schultz, a movement combining animal welfare and environmental protection.

She says that in order to do work she can't wear her pajamas because then she is not in the right frame of mind.

### Luxury Brands Succeed In Growing Audience On TikTok

Fashion and lifestyle creator Brittany Xavier has 3 million followers on the TikTok app compared to 1.6 million on Instagram.
She is one of the earliest adopters of TikTok.

Luxury brands have to be attuned to trends if they want to succeed on TikTok and similar short video formats platforms.
The younger generation dominates Tiktok and might not be an immediate driver of sales. According to one brand officer - They
are still approaching [TikTok and Instagram] as a way to increase their brand awareness.

<p><img src="{{site.url}}/images/resized/480/newsletter_17_nov_post2.jpg" alt="" srcset="            {{site.url}}/images/resized/320/newsletter_17_nov_post2.jpg 320w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/480/newsletter_17_nov_post2.jpg 480w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/600/newsletter_17_nov_post2.jpg 600w,    " /></p>

The short-form video has helped a surge in styling videos or "how-to's from some
content creators. Xavier said that the rise of the short-form video
came at just the right time with both TikTok and its new competitor,
Instagram's short-form video feature. She only sees short form growing.

Xavier says that the Gen Z audience is just going more for short-form videos in general.

### Gucci Is Not The Only Fashion House To Collaborate with the Film Makers

Gucci's new virtual film festival has come up with the seven-part mini-series.
The film series takes the audience into the life of a woman, who with her Gucci tribe moves through a rarified Roman landscape, from her shabby chic apartment to a theater, cafe, and vintage shop. Silvia is joined by Gucci models, all wearing the looks that will be in stores starting next spring.

According to Gucci's creative director Alessandro Michele, the pandemic created a speedier reaction to the need to follow
a new narrative and new communication.

Luxury brands like Gucci are no more out of reach and have been "freed from their traps", as put forward by Michele.

American director Van Sant mentioned that as cinema starts to get sucked into the computer screen, the combination of cinema with exposing fashion ideas has a lot of potential.


Gucci is not the first fashion house to team up and collaborate with a filmmaker to bring out fashion shows in a new format.
