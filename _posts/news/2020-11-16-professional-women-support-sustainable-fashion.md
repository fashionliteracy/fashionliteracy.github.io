### Professional Women Support Sustainable Fashion

Fast fashion is a business model that takes looks from runways and produces the same for masses at cheaper prices. In 2013, the Rana Plaza clothing factory in Bangladesh collapsed, killing over 1,000 workers. Professional women who support sustainability in all areas of their lives are now first in line for circular fashion and are playing a key role in its implementation.

This article presents the views of Rick Gomez and an understanding of how CMOs are navigating the pandemic.
The goal is to drive a net positive impact on the societies in which they operate. The pandemic has negatively impacted society along with race, gender, and socioeconomic lines.

According to Rick, if you really want your brand to have empathy and be able to respond appropriately, you need diverse teams.
CMOs should be focusing on the extraordinary things their companies did. They should codify them into new ways of working that will make them less bureaucratic.

Companies should be more agile, creative, diverse, innovative, productive, collaborative.

### Fast fashion at Inditex has a technological edge

Inditex, as one of the big fashion retailers, sells in 202 markets through its online platform. It also sells in over 7,000 stores in 96 markets. The majority of the business of the brand comes from Zara (+ Zara Home)

The sales of Inditex are more in Europe (62%), showing that there is still room for growth in other markets.

In order to stay ahead of the competition, Inditex is pushing a number of technological innovations.
It is accelerating its development plans by spending €2.7 billion over the next three years.

The pandemic has resulted in longer-term fashion trends and has changed fashion and shopping, decreasing the sales
of workwear and increasing the sales of casual wear and sportswear. This is where the technological innovations by Inditex to integrate stores and online inventories can hopefully help in avoiding access products in the inventory.

### Brands' Social Activism Gets Stronger

Paula-Andrea created her brand Visa Issues out of frustration with her status and the jarring language of immigration notices.
Fleeing Colombia after the Pablo Escobar era, Paula-Andrea emigrated to the u.s. at 11 years old. She didn’t learn until she was applying for college that her father brought her here with unauthorized documents.

<p><img src="{{site.url}}/images/resized/480/newsletter_16_nov_post3.jpg" alt="" srcset="            {{site.url}}/images/resized/320/newsletter_16_nov_post3.jpg 320w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/480/newsletter_16_nov_post3.jpg 480w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/600/newsletter_16_nov_post3.jpg 600w,    " /></p>

To safely promote her brand amid Covid-19, Paula-Andrea relies on social media.
Look at some of her Instagram Ads. About the Sweat Shirt that she wore while flying to San Fransico She says, "I tried to use this sweatshirt in an angry way. but I realized that it was so much bigger than my anger," says Paula-Andrea.
