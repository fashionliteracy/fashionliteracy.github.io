### Seven Fashion Loyalty Trends in Europe

These days, Fashion brands need to go beyond high-quality products and
discounts by bringing contemporary and relevant customer loyalty programs.

<p><img src="{{site.url}}/images/resized/480/newsletter_02_nov_post1.png" alt="" srcset="            {{site.url}}/images/resized/320/newsletter_02_nov_post1.png 320w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/480/newsletter_02_nov_post1.png 480w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/600/newsletter_02_nov_post1.png 600w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/800/newsletter_02_nov_post1.png 800w,    " /></p>

The brands need to offer incentives that resonate well with the customers and
help brands in reducing customer churn, increase footfall ( these days increase
in no of visits and the duration of session time), and increased eco
consciousness.

Some examples of best loyalty programs are Next-Gen
Program Structure, Sophisticated Rewards, and Seamless In-store Experience.
In addition, read more about examples from H&M, Nicce, Urban Outfitters, Love
Bonito, and others in an article written by Zsuzsa Kecsmar

### Can bespoke clothing solve sustainability crisis in Fashion?

The concept of bespoke, made-to-measure has taken a new form. It seems that we
do not want to be part of standard sizing system and want to adopt technology
and new measures to find solace in the trends which were historically popular
before 1940's.


<p><img src="{{site.url}}/images/resized/480/newsletter_02_nov_post2.jpg" alt="" srcset="            {{site.url}}/images/resized/320/newsletter_02_nov_post2.jpg 320w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/480/newsletter_02_nov_post2.jpg 480w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/600/newsletter_02_nov_post2.jpg 600w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/800/newsletter_02_nov_post2.jpg 800w,    " /></p>


However, how is this possible and can overcome challenges of maintaining low
cost and high quality of garments amid efforts of keeping
sustainble trends? 

Sophie has explored the topic
and she shares here experience in [The rise of bespoke clothing: Is made-to-measure the answer to fashionâ€™s
sustainability
crisis?](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/fast-fashion-sustainability-unspun-megan-crosby-son-of-a-tailor-testing-review-bespoke-b1039464.html)
