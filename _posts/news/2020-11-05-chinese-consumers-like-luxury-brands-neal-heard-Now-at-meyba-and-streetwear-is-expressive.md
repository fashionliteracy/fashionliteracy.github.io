### Chinese Consumers Like Luxury Fashion Brands and Vice Versa

China government has allowed more than 60 foreign luxury brands 
to enter the Chinese market since the year 2018.

Chinese tend to buy luxury goods while they travel outside their countries. Moreover, these luxury brands know how to engage with their Chinese customers on social media websites such as WeChat and Weibo.

Luxury brands are dependent on Chinese consumers because most of their revenue comes from Chinese consumers, as evident from the newly released report by Deutsche Bank.
