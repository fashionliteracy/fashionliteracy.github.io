### Desi Bellé by Killer Jeans

India's leading denim brand, Killer Jeans, has launched a brand Desi Bele under
their "www" campaign. Quite exiting activities are planned by Killer Jeans as
part of social media viral content marketing, influencer tie-ups, and
merchandizing.

This "www" or "WorldWideWest" initiative by the brand brings western fashion
directly to India with a tag line "break free", which is apt for Desi Bellé and
Indian woman, who is ready to take on the world by panache, a woman who is not
afraid to try different styles and wants to break free from the regular
fashion.

### Gucci's Film Festival

Industry power houses have been pondering and trying to bring their innovative
responses to the hard ships posed by pandemic and climate crisis.

In May, Gucci's creative directory posted a soul searching letter on Instagram,
informing fashion fans and the world that they would stage two collections per
year.

Michelle has been tweaking and iterating on creative ways to showcase Gucci's
collections since May this year.

It is probably a wise way to engage rising content hungry global audience,
whose behavior has been changing in these new situations.
