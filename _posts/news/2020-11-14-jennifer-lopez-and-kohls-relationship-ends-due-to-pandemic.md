### Jennifer Lopez and Kohls Relationship Ends Due To Pandemic

The J Lo lifestyle brand was first founded in 2001 and then relaunched in 2010. 
Their department store chain recently ended its ten-year-long partnership with the
star due to a 43% fall in net sales when the Coronavirus pandemic hit.

She also owned The Sweetface fashion line, which ran from 2003 to 2009 when it was halted. 
The company issued a statement at the time saying, "we have decided to put the Sweetface line on hiatus"

In 2010, the star decided to relaunch J Lo by Jennifer Lopez.
This time it was launched in partnership with Kohls. 
At the time, the star had learned from the failure of her previous attempt.

Jennifer's fashion line was among eight 'down-trending women's private brands' that received the boot.

After a decade long partnership, the department store chain dropped her from
their stores because Kohls' CEO thinks that exiting them will create focus and clarity on
the brands that will continue.

The star has a shoe line in partnership with DSW and a footwear partnership with Giuseppe Zanotti. 
She also has a footwear partnership with Giuseppe Zanotti and is the face of three major brands.

### AR and 3D Are Not New Concepts To Fashion Industry

The implementation of concepts such as Augmented reality and the 3D platform is not new in the fashion industry.
The use of such concepts has surged in the era of COVID. 

The brands that focus on fashion can actually take AR's advantage by using 3D designs
and virtual try-on because touch and try on apparel was the most important factor when customers purchase online.

<p><img src="{{site.url}}/images/resized/480/newsletter_14_nov_post2.jpg" alt="AR and 3D are not new to the fashion industry" srcset="            {{site.url}}/images/resized/320/newsletter_14_nov_post2.jpg 320w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/480/newsletter_14_nov_post2.jpg 480w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/600/newsletter_14_nov_post2.jpg 600w,    " /></p>

Moreover, brands that use this technology have seen a huge lift in their conversion rates.
Brands now can simulate avatar's in customers home using AR. Shopify has reported increased online sales because 3D and AR shopping
gives a better understanding of the products to the customers. It is especially more effective in the case of accessories and bags.

Additionally, communication between designers and brands can be streamlined when 3D models are incorporated.

Given today's situation, remote workers can really make use of technology integrations as provided by VNTANA.

### Maggie Marilyn Moves to DTC Model

New Zealand based label Maggie Marilyn has "said goodbye" to its wholesalers. 
Now customers can only purchase from the brand's website or from the bricks and mortar store. 

The brand has also abandoned traditional fashion calendar rules.
since ‘Somewhere’s’ 2019 launch Maggie Marilyn has seen a 140% revenue increase and 90% web traffic increase each quarter. 

<p><img src="{{site.url}}/images/resized/480/newsletter_14_nov_post3.jpg" alt="Maggie Marilyn moves to DTC model" srcset="            {{site.url}}/images/resized/320/newsletter_14_nov_post3.jpg 320w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/480/newsletter_14_nov_post3.jpg 480w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/600/newsletter_14_nov_post3.jpg 600w,    " /></p>

This shift to DTC will mean that Marilyn will be able to abandon markdowns,
firming confidence with partners of its continued investment.


The brand is also set to launch a repairs scheme. Under this scheme customers
can return pieces that have developed 'love marks' so that those can be
repaired for free. 

Marilyn has celebrated its new beginning with the opening of its first retail
store, the first of many she hopes to open around the world.
