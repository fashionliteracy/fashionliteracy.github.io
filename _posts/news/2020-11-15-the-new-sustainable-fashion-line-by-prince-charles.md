### The New Sustainable Fashion Line by Prince Charles

Prince Charles's luxury-yet-sustainable line comprises an 18-piece capsule collection – 10 pieces of womenswear and eight pieces of menswear –created through a partnership between the prince’s foundation, the royal charity, and the fashion retailer.


The designs have da Vinci’s inspirations and can be seen in details such as knots, and his draping techniques are recognized in pleats, folds, and bows. The menswear collection features pieces such as a camel-colored coat, a white turtleneck, and a deep red knit cardigan. The womenswear collection features fitted suits, a burnt orange blouse with a pussy bow, and a navy blue dress with a cinched waist.

This collection was designed in Italy by students from Politecnico di Milano’s Fashion in Process school and crafted in the UK, and has been designed to be “passed down through generations”.


Each item of clothing was made using natural and organic material where possible. For example, cashmere and wool made in Scotland and organic eco silk sourced in Italy. Charles says that 'the key for me is to rediscover the importance that nature plays, understand where natural materials come from and how they can be used in exciting and innovative ways'
