Amid this ongoing crisis and chaos, when fashion brands are closing, digital
magazines are folded or moving completely towards digitization, Fashion
Literacy selected an article published by the New York Times.

In the article, by Lou Stoppard, you will find the history of photography in
fashion. The author provides textual glimpses of the legendary fashion
photographers in the 1930's and 1940's such as Louise Dahl-Wolfe and
photographers of today such as Collier Schorr.
