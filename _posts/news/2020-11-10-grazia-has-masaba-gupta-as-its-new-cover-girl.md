### Purple Dot raises €1.49 million. 

Purple Dot has raised €1.49 million. Fashion industry is going to get disrupted
with this new payment option called 'worth-the-wait'. This new payment option
is going to sit at par with 'buy now, pay later' finance options.

<p><img src="{{site.url}}/images/resized/480/newsletter_10_nov_post1.jpg" alt="Purple Dot raises funds" srcset="            {{site.url}}/images/resized/320/newsletter_10_nov_post1.jpg 320w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/480/newsletter_10_nov_post1.jpg 480w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/600/newsletter_10_nov_post1.jpg 600w,    " /></p>

The idea of Purple Dot came from childhood experiences of Madelline Para, the company's founder.
When out shopping, Madeline’s grandmother would often ask the store-clerk to
ring her if she found an item she liked that was currently too expensive – the
clerk would take down her name in the sales waitlist book.

In Purple Dot payment method, customers pay upfront, and then wait to have the item
confirmed, receiving a full refund if not. 

To know more about the Purple Dot method and about the ways it will fight against
unsustainable and unrelenting consumerism, poor pricing tactics, and profit-crunching sales at the same
time read the article [London-based Purple Dot raises €1.49 million to disrupt the fashion industry with a new fintech approach](https://www.eu-startups.com/2020/11/london-based-purple-dot-raises-e1-49-million-to-disrupt-the-fashion-industry-with-a-new-finfech-approach/)

deals.  LMVH is going forward with its aquisition of Tinffany & Co. Alibaba and
Richemont recently went ahead investing millions in Farfetch and Farfetch China
to create a global conglomerate.

<p><img src="{{site.url}}/images/resized/480/newsletter_10_nov_post2.jpg" alt="VF Corporation acquires Supreme for 2 Bn dollars" srcset="            {{site.url}}/images/resized/320/newsletter_10_nov_post2.jpg 320w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/480/newsletter_10_nov_post2.jpg 480w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/600/newsletter_10_nov_post2.jpg 600w,    " /></p>

### Designers of Tunisia embrace traditions and ethics 

Tunisian designers like Mechri have found solace in going back to their roots,
embracing local artisans and environmentally concious materials. It is quite a
trend to watch in this globalized world dominate by fast fashion brands such as
H&M, Topshop, and Zara.

<p><img src="{{site.url}}/images/resized/480/newsletter_10_nov_post3.jpg" alt="VF Corporation acquires Supreme for 2 Bn dollars" srcset="            {{site.url}}/images/resized/320/newsletter_10_nov_post3.jpg 320w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/480/newsletter_10_nov_post3.jpg 480w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/600/newsletter_10_nov_post3.jpg 600w,    " /></p>

Mechri sources from Ismail, who works with North African nation's age old
textile-making traditions. Ismail has been spinning  wool and cotton, sourced
locally, as well as silk thread imported from China, for the last 47 years.

Businesses that strike a balance between ethical industrial practices and
community-driven craftmanship offer Tunisia “a hope of a better tomorrow.”
