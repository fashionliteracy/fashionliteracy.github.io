### IDFW becomes inclusive and diverse for a massive audience

### Runways combined with Digital shows have received positive feedbacks

The most recent Paris Fashion Week showed that runway shows are not obsolete. Brands that
staged hybrid events fared better globally than those opting for strictly online presence.

According to DMR Group, Paris Fashion Week generated highest value of the four spring 2021 Fashion Weeks.

### To be a Stylist you have to be a storyteller

Fashion is an extension of who we are. The clothing that we wear communicates our expressions to 
the outside world - what we feel, value, and believe.

Jessica Alba, Amy Schumer, and other A-list celebrities were seen sporting apparel in support of Black lives and voting rights.

In 2020, if you are not leading with the messages about social justice, you're seen
as deaf and canceled. Brands too were seen tacking their publicly known radical 
blindspots.
