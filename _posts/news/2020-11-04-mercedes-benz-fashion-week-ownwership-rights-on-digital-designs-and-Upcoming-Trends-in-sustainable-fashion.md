### Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week 2020

The World witnessed Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week from 19th October to 23rd October.

a digital schedule which was live-streamed over 87 platforms, encompassing both regular media and social media, in 14 countries
, including Be Global Fashion Network.

This fashion week generated more than 2400 minutes of live streams. You could have a look at behind-the-scenes and lifting of veil streams of the organizing process. Everyone from key Russian experts to TikTok creators to social media influencers was

### Who owns the digital rights over the designs?

In this new culture of collaboration, stakeholders have started making digital
versions of their designs and it requires more number of inputs to make digital
versions of a garment so that it can be successfully be presented to the new
and generation next consumers online.

<p><img src="{{site.url}}/images/resized/480/newsletter_04_nov_post2.png" alt="" srcset="            {{site.url}}/images/resized/320/newsletter_04_nov_post2.png 320w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/480/newsletter_04_nov_post2.png 480w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/600/newsletter_04_nov_post2.png 600w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/800/newsletter_04_nov_post2.png 800w,    " /></p>

However, this raises concerns over the sharing of IP writes and ownership
issues over the created designs. It is still a grey area and up for the
community to discuss. It definitely requires stepping up and bringing
reformation in existing policies and contracts between software designers,
garment designers, and other stakeholders.

### A look at upcoming trends in sustainable Fashion

The understanding of sustainable fashion in changing; It is moving away from the
traditional neutral hues and classic styles to the designs that are more
colorful and bright.

Designers all around the globe are innovating in ways which can lift up the
mood of more ecological and responsible consumers, especially in the times of
lockdowns and pandemic.

Some of sustainable keywords for the next years are diversity, inclusivity,
second-hand wear, and environmental justice to produce responsible designs and
garments.
