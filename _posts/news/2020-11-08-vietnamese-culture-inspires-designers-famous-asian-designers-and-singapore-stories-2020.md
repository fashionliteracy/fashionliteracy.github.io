### Inspiring Asian Fashion Designers

We tend to find inspiring individuals around us and follow them in order to live meaningfully.
Some great and talented individuals are the likes of Margot Robbie and Amal Clooney.

Many of us might have already heard about Jason Wu, who was a finalist in the
CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund in 2008.  Currently, He is the Director of Hugo Boss
womens' ready to wear and accessories. 

<p><img src="{{site.url}}/images/resized/480/newsletter_08_nov_post2.jpg" alt="Inspiring Asian Fashion Designers" srcset="            {{site.url}}/images/resized/320/newsletter_08_nov_post2.jpg 320w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/480/newsletter_08_nov_post2.jpg 480w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/600/newsletter_08_nov_post2.jpg 600w,    " /></p>

He also is growing his epononymous
brand.  Jason has also been praised by none other than Michelle Obama for his
impeccable attention to fit and detail and unique understanding of how women
want to dress and feel in theircloting.

Another similar inspiring personality is Gurung, who migrated to America from
Nepal, where he says that women in their full feminine glory, in colour and
texture, was kind of unnerving for men.  He designs pieces that are bold and
empowering for modern woman and brings attention to discrimination in society
through showcasing them on social media.

There are many such one of their kind examples for all of us to get inspired. Read
