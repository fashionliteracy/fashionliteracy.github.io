### Federico Bellezza's Supernova will become the new fashion statement 


A new concept of garment exchange will become the new fashion statement of 2021.

concept in clothing line.

### Tech and Sustainability Merges in Amsterdam 
 
Amsterdam's foreign investment agency manager, Marike Geertsma, says that they are helping
fashion to reimagine its business models. Fashion startups are getting a real push to 
experiment in both technology and sustainability in the areas of 3D digital design, biodesigned textiles
and new manufacturing techniques.

### Slow Adoption of 3D Fashion Software in Fashion Industry

Adoption of 3D fashion design software faces some resistance from beginners and
the ones who have not been exploring the benefits that it has to offer. Let us
explore some reasons that 3D fashion design software is facing slow adoption in
fashion industry.

<p><img src="{{site.url}}/images/newsletter_09_nov_post3.jpg" alt="" srcset="            {{site.url}}/images/resized/320/newsletter_09_nov_post3.jpg 320w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/480/newsletter_09_nov_post3.jpg 480w,            {{site.url}}/images/resized/600/newsletter_09_nov_post3.jpg 600w,    " /></p>

Some of the fears responsible for this slow adoption are :-

- Fear around scalability like how much time it would take to onboard and other
  related concerns
- Fear of starting with a new technology
- Fear of change as it might require changes in existing processes
- Fear of loss of Job

Well, read the article [Why Apparel Designers Need to Conquer their Fear of
3D](https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/technology/3d-apparel-design-clo-fashion-patternmakers-product-development-241969/)
