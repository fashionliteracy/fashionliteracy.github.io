Producers produce and consumers consume. Such a well-defined activity. However,
there are some questions that need answers : -

1. What about the connecting link between producers and consumers?
2. How do the products actually reach the consumers?
3. What are the missing links of the supply chain?
4. How are the goods distributed to the end-users?

Most of us are aware of the distribution strategy. There are two major distribution
channels:

1. Wholesale channel
2. Retail channel

**But are these two traditional channels enough in this age of globalisation?**

    The answer is NO.


Businesses dependent on only these two channels have the risk of lagging behind
their competitors in this era of consumerism.

To cover this risk the retail industry has seen the development of another
channel called _**transnational distribution channel**_. As the name suggests, the
a company's operations span multiple nations. Transnational distribution channel involves
merging of all the channels viz offline, online, wholesale and retail into one
channel.

The evolution of transnational distribution channel format dates back to 1980s when the home market
of the manufacturers and retailers got saturated. American and European
retailers sought expansion of their market in East and came at loggerheads with
complexities due to the differences in culture , demography, and regulations.

However, acceleration in FDI promoted the emergence of transnational firms in
the 1990s and vice versa.

There are various considerations when it comes to transnational retailing. The
important ones are creating a proper product mix, selecting the store locations,
optimising the supply chain and planning a good marketing strategy.

Examples of transnational firms :

1. Tesco (UK)
2. Carrefour(France)
3. Walmart(US)
4. Metro(Germany)
5. IKEA(Sweden)

Two formats under this channel are:

1. Duty-Free
2. Travel Retail Stores

Duty-free and travel retail are retail outlets for international travelers. 

The products in this format are exempted from local taxes and duties. These stores
are usually found in the airports, seaports or the international railway
stations.


Online Stores and Online business has revolutionized the retail industry by erasing
the boundaries and making the world a global village.


In fact, Online retail has seen exponential growth, especially in the time of the
pandemic.  The most significant consumer demand in the world is the e-retail
market with the fastest growing e-commerce market of all time.

In a situation when the world is confined to their homes, the shopping appetite
is being fulfilled by the e-retail platforms like Amazon, AJio, Myntra, and
similar other ones. Moreover, several brands such as H&M, Abercrombie, and
Fitch have independent online stores and separate shopping apps. These separate
online stores help them manage their consumer needs and demands. Other existing
and emerging brands need to follow these trends and facilitate buying and
purchasing their products online.
